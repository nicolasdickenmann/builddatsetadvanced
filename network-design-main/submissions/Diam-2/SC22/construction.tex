\section{Construction}
{\color{red}Laura and Kelly: A page or two for all of these? With references, that should work? Need enough so people can reproduce these, but if they want proofs and the like, they can go elsewhere. Bib not included in the 10-page count.}


\subsection{Erdos-Renyi Graphs}

\subsubsection{Generalized Polygons/Triangles}

\subsubsection{Finite Geometry, Polarity, Moore Bound}

\subsubsection{Intuition on the structure, Quadric vertices}

\klcomment{Only discuss even degree (odd $q$) graphs - they cover
most of the degrees.}

\subsection{Abas Graph Construction}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Exist for all degrees
    \item vertex transitive
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Semidirect Product, Moore Bound}

\subsubsection{Intuition on structure, Two sets of vertices}

{\color{red}
	\subsection{Compare-and-contrast}
	Laura and Kelly: How do these relate to each other? How do they differ? How does this speak to diameter and degree? A brief description on the math differences. What are the constraints we are using, like for instance the odd $q$ that Kartik mentions above. Maybe a couple of paragraphs on this ...
