\section{Background}
\label{sec:back}

We start with background; Table~\ref{tab:symbols} lists 
key symbols. 

\subsection{Technology}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Copackaging
        \item Swizzles/shufflers
    \end{itemize}

\subsection{Network Model}

\subsubsection{Network Features: Scalability/Moore's Bound}

\subsubsection{Network Features: Expandability/Modularity}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Purchased system size limited by budget

        \item Radix size determined by system size + technology - can be overprovisioned

        \item Increase system size later with minimal effort
    \end{itemize}

\subsection{Diameter-2 Network Topologies}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item We explore diameter-2 topologies for copackaged networks.
        They support higher ingestion bandwidth for a given network 
        radix per router, compared to higher diameter topologies.
        Lower latency. Pragmatic - can scale to several thousands of nodes with
        off-the-shelf switches. 
    
        \item Direct, Indirect, HyperX, OFTs, SlimFly.

        \item Limitations
    \end{itemize}
