  abstract     = {Systems as diverse as genetic networks or the World Wide Web are best described as networks with complex topology. A common property of many large networks is that the vertex connectivities follow a scale-free power-law distribution. This feature was found to be a consequence of two generic mechanisms: (i) networks expand continuously by the addition of new vertices, and (ii) new vertices attach preferentially to sites that are already well connected. A model based on these two ingredients reproduces the observed stationary scale-free distributions, which indicates that the development of large networks is governed by robust self-organizing phenomena that go beyond the particulars of the individual systems.},

To address these issues, we present the design and implementation of a system for providing coordinated checkpointing and rollback recovery for MPI-based parallel applications. Our approach integrates the Berkeley Lab BLCR kernel-level process checkpoint system with the LAM implementation of MPI through a defined checkpoint/restart interface. Checkpointing is transparent to the application, allowing the system to be used for cluster maintenance and scheduling reasons as well as for fault tolerance. Experimental results show negligible communication performance impact due to the incorporation of the checkpoint support capabilities into LAM/MPI.},

  @abstract    = {Among the low-diameter, high-radix networks being deployed in next-generation HPC systems, dual-rail fat-tree networks are a promising approach. Adding additional injection connections (rails) to one or more network planes allows multi-rail fat-tree networks to alleviate communication bottlenecks. These multi-rail networks necessitate new design considerations, such as routing choices, job placements, and scalability of rails. We extend our fat-tree network model in the CODES parallel simulation framework to support multi-rail and multi-plane configurations in addition to different types of static routing, resulting in a powerful research vehicle for fat-tree network analysis. Our detailed packet-level simulations use communication traces from real applications to make performance predictions and to evaluate the impact of single- and multi-rail networks in conjunction with schemes for injection rail selection and intra-plane routing.},

  abstract     = {High computational power of commodity PCs combined with the emergence of low latency and high bandwidth interconnects has escalated the trends of cluster computing. Clusters with InfiniBand are being deployed, as reflected in the TOP 500 Supercomputer rankings. However, increasing scale of these clusters has reduced the mean time between failures (MTBF) of components. Network component is one such component of clusters, where failure of network interface cards (NICs), cables and/or switches breaks existing path(s) of communication. InfiniBand provides a hardware mechanism, automatic path migration (APM), which allows user transparent detection and recovery from network fault(s), without application restart. In this paper, we design a set of modules; which work together for providing network fault tolerance for user level applications leveraging the APM feature. Our performance evaluation at the MPI layer shows that APM incurs negligible overhead in the absence of faults in the system. In the presence of network faults, APM incurs negligible overhead for reasonably long running applications.},
