\subsection{ER Graphs}

\subsubsection{Method 1}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item  Replicate $C_0$ cluster/rack, easy to implement
        \item  $q+1$ increase in no. of nodes for $2$ units increase in degree
        \item  Diameter preserved
        \item  Repeated incremental growth can lead to bandwidth issues
    \end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Method 2}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item  Replicate $C_i$ cluster/rack, easy to implement
        \item  $q$ increase in no. of nodes per increment in degree
        \item  Diameter increases to $3$ but average path length $<=2$
        \item  Potentially better bandwidth
    \end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Method 3}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Move to the next available ER graph topology
        \item Gives best scale, performance
        \item Requires adding nodes to each rack/cluster, and reconfiguring all 
              shuffle boxes
    \end{itemize}
